Q. What if you are currently on a different app which you want to use?
A. Press Home button and then find the app.

Q. How to find apps?
A. Scroll up/down in home screen. typically there are 5-6 screens. sometimes apps might be inside folders. 

Suggestions - 
1. Keep track of what you are doing and what you have done so you don't get lost and don't repeat same things.
2. If you feel your click action is not doing anything try adjusting the coordinates.
3. Typically if you press a search bar you can start typing. no need to try clicking again and again. 
4. If something is stuck you can retry your tool call or re do some previous steps. or just clicking back button.
